                <div class="section-about--text  animated fadeInLeft wow ">
                  Over 70% of our world is covered by the oceans, yet the
                  majority of people will never witness the wonders that lie
                  beneath the surface. <br />
                  <br />
                  Scuba diving gives us the ability to journey into this alien
                  world and be a witness to life seldom seen by human eyes. With
                  scuba we are able to explore this strange and beautiful world,
                  not limited by a single breath. <br />
                  <br />We witness with our own eyes life in action as a
                  multitude of species dance on a reef. We touch history when
                  exploring ships once lost at sea and witness how nature uses a
                  tragic loss to create life on the ocean floor.

                  Inner peace

                <div class="section-about--text animated fadeInRight wow ">
                  Scuba provides an inner peace not easily found on land. The
                  rhythmic sound of your breathing sets a mood of serenity
                  throughout each dive. <br />
                  <br />Your slow, deliberate movements relax your mind and
                  body, releasing tension of your every day life. Scuba diving
                  gives you freedom from the weight of the world, allowing you
                  to escape for a few moments in time while reconnecting with
                  nature. <br />
                  <br />Freedom from ringing cell phones, pending deadlines, and
                  long workdays. It is an escape to the kind of peace and
                  tranquility which feeds your soul. For scuba divers, the time
                  between dives is spent daydreaming of when we will return to
                  this special world. <br />
                  <br />
                  We dream of adventure and feel the gentle tug of mystery which
                  beckons our return. We have a common passion and enjoy the
                  camaraderie we share.
